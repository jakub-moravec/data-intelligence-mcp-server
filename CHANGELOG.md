# Changelog

> All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project **adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)**.

## [1.4.0] - Aug 6th, 2026

### Added
- **Workflow**:
  - `get_artifact_details` - Retrieves detailed information about draft glossary terms or data classes, including version comparison between latest and previous drafts with descriptions, relationships, and data steward names
  - `list_draft_artifacts` - Lists all draft business terms and data classes with artifact IDs, version IDs, workflow states, and UI URLs
- **Data Protection Rules (DPS)**:
  - `get_policy_metrics` - New tool to retrieve and aggregate DPS policy enforcement metrics for a specified time period. Supports querying enforcements, denials, operational policies, and operational rules, aggregated by days, months, years, policies, rules, users, outcomes, governance type, PEP host types, cache status, context operations/locations, and asset types/locations. Accepts optional filters for policy ID, rule ID, user, governance type, outcome, PEP host type, cache flag, context operation/location, asset type/location, and sort order.
- **Search**:
  - `execute_gs_query` - Execute a GS (Global Search) formatted Elasticsearch DSL query directly against the global search index. Supports standard ES DSL, GS full-text search with optional field restriction and NLQ analysis, and GS semantic/AI search. Also accepts a natural language query that is automatically converted to an ES DSL body by the text-to-query service when no explicit query is supplied. Results are capped at 10000 documents. Optional parameters allow fine-grained control over ACL filtering, index type selection, and tenant scoping. Returns hit count, typed rows, aggregations, and semantic search expansions.
- **Metadata Import (MDI)**:
  - `pause_resume_or_cancel_mdi_job_run` - Pause, resume, or cancel a metadata import job run. Automatically targets the latest eligible run for the requested action when no `job_run_id` is provided. Cancel is permanent and cannot be undone.
  - `delete_metadata_import` - Permanently deletes a metadata import asset from a project. This action cannot be undone.
  - `edit_metadata_import` - Edits an existing metadata import asset in a project; supports updating description, scope, tags, import_type, reimport_options, and import_options. When supplying reimport_options or import_options, all keys must be provided.
  - `bulk_publish_assets` - Publishes multiple data assets in bulk from a metadata import operation to a target catalog.

### Changed
- **Metadata Import (MDI)**:
  - `create_metadata_import` - Enhanced to accept an optional `catalog_name` parameter. When provided, metadata will be imported to the specified target catalog instead of the project. Also accepts optional `tags`, `migrate_tags`, `reimport_options`, and `import_options` parameters; unspecified option fields retain their defaults.

### Fixed
- **Data Protection Rules**:
  - `search_governance_artifacts` - Extended support to all 6 governance artifact types. Previously only `classification`, `data_class`, and `glossary_term` were accepted; `policy`, `rule`, and `reference_data` are now supported.
- **Text to Query Search**:
  - `dynamic_query_search` - `policy` and `rule` artifact types are now treated as glossary-scope types (no container lookup, correct URL pattern), consistent with `classification`, `data_class`, `glossary_term`, and `reference_data`.

## [1.3.0] - Jul 17th, 2026

### Added
- **Metadata Enrichment**
  - `create_or_metadata_enrichment_asset_jobs` - New tool to create a new Job for a given MDE in a given project.
  - `list_metadata_enrichment_asset_jobs` - New tool to list the available jobs for a given MDE in a given project.
- **Projects**:
  - `publish_asset_to_catalog` - New tool to publish an asset from a source project to a target catalog using the platform's publish behavior.
  - `add_asset_to_project` - New tool to add a catalog asset to a project by creating a reference. Supports asset and project lookup by ID or name, validates admin/editor access on the target project (including IAM group-based access), automatically searches all accessible catalogs when no catalog is specified, and checks for duplicates before adding. Returns asset ID, project ID/name, catalog ID/name, and a direct asset URL. Additionally, once the asset is in the project, you can also call `create_asset_from_sql_query` to create a SQL view on top of it.
- **Search**:
  - `update_asset_metadata` - New tool for updating asset metadata in catalogs or projects. Supports updating asset name, display name, description, privacy (ROV), format, tags, business terms, classifications, and related items (assets, artifacts, columns).
- **Data Product Hub (DPH)**:
  - `get_data_contract_test_results` - Retrieve data contract test results for draft or published data products, including test status, last tested time, test summary, and other metadata.

### Changed
- **Metadata Enrichment**
  - `create_or_update_metadata_enrichment_asset` - The tool was updated to follow the new `Multi Jobs` support. With the new feature we create separately the MDE (without objectives and categories) and then we create one or more jobs with different objectives, categories, etc.
  - `execute_metadata_enrichment_asset` - Updated the tool to support the new `Multi Jobs` feature.
- **Glossary**:
  - `explain_glossary_artifact` - Improved disambiguation logic to avoid false matches when an artifact name is similar to non-glossary artifact names.

### Fixed

- **Text to SQL**:
  - `enable_container_for_text_to_sql` - Fixed onboarding for catalogs. Users will now provide a project when onboarding catalogs to create an onboarding job in.
  - `check_if_onboarding_job_is_completed` - Fixed checking onboarding job status for catalogs. Users will now provide the project in which onboarding job was created when checking onboarding status for catalogs.

## [1.2.0] - June 12th, 2026

- **Text to SQL**:
  - `get_semantic_model` - Retrieve schema assets and metadata for text-to-SQL operations. Searches for relevant data assets based on user queries and returns detailed schema information including column metadata, primary keys, foreign keys, and profiling data. Supports filtering by container (project/catalog), connection, asset IDs, data source definitions, and document libraries.

### Changed 
- **Projects**:
  - `add_or_edit_collaborator` - Enhanced to support both **projects** and **catalogs**. Added `container_type` parameter (defaults to "project" for backward compatibility).

  - `create_project` - Improved user experience when project name is not provided. The tool now raises a clear error message asking users to provide a meaningful project name, instead of suggesting unhelpful auto-generated names with timestamps (e.g., `mcp_generated_project_2026-05-05 16-53-06`). This reduces cognitive load and guides users to provide better project names.
- **Data Quality**:

  - `data_product_create_or_update_from_asset_in_container` tool to create a data product draft from asset in catalog or project, or update an existing draft with a catalog or project asset. If an existing draft ID is passed from the context, then this is an update operation to add the given asset from catalog or project to an existing draft.

### Changed
- Lineage tools now return the path of an asset based on hierarchy instead of identity_key
- `data_product_find_delivery_methods_based_on_connection` also accepts a mandatory input - data asset name. This is the name of the data asset for which we need to find the delivery method options.
- `data_product_add_delivery_methods_to_data_product` also accepts a mandatory input - data asset name. This is the name of the data asset in the data product draft for which we need to add delivery methods.

### Removed
- `get_system_prompts` tool - This tool was retrieving tool descriptions, which MCP clients can already retrieve from tool registration
- `data_product_create_url_data_product` tool (replaced by `data_product_create_or_update_url_data_product`)
- `data_product_create_data_product_from_asset_in_container` tool (replaced by `data_product_create_or_update_from_asset_in_container`)


## [0.3.1] - Nov 13th, 2025

### Added
- `convert_to_lineage_id` tool that returns the lineage ID of a CAMS asset as a replacement for the `get_lineage_graph_by_cams_id` tool
- `data_product_get_assets_from_container` tool to retrieve assets from a container based on container type (either `project` or `catalog`). This tool replaces `data_product_get_assets_from_catalog`, which only fetched assets from catalogs
- `data_product_create_data_product_from_asset_in_container` tool to create a data product from an asset in a container (either `project` or `catalog`). This tool replaces `data_product_create_data_product_from_catalog`, which only created data products from catalogs
- PyPI and CPD version information indicating when tools became available for each tool in the `TOOLS_PROMPTS.md` file

### Changed
- `enable_project_for_text_to_sql` tool now accepts both project ID and project name

- `search_lineage_assets` tool now returns lineage assets with their parent assets and tags
- `get_lineage_graph` tool now includes additional parameters to specify the number of upstream and downstream levels in the lineage graph (`hop_up`, `hop_down`) and the `ultimate` parameter
- `get_lineage_graph` tool now accepts a list of asset IDs as input and returns a list of edges in the graph
- `data_product_create_url_data_product` tool now returns a URL to the data product draft
- `data_product_publish_data_product` tool now returns a URL to the published data product
- `data_product_search_data_product` tool now returns a message indicating that the tool returns a maximum of 20 data products
- Error message when certificates are missing for HTTPS mode
- Validations for empty search prompts and invalid container types, and tool descriptions for the `search_asset` tool

### Removed
- `get_lineage_graph_by_cams_id` tool (replaced by `convert_to_lineage_id` tool)
- `data_product_get_assets_from_catalog` tool (replaced by `data_product_get_assets_from_container` tool)
- `data_product_create_data_product_from_catalog` tool (replaced by `data_product_create_data_product_from_asset_in_container` tool)

## [0.2.0] - Oct 24th, 2025

### Added
