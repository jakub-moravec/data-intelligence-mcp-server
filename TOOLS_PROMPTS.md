## Usage Guidelines

When using these tools:

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for the operation
2. Provide all required parameters as specified in the tool documentation
3. Handle any returned errors appropriately
4. For data product operations, follow the proper sequence (create → attach domain/contract → add delivery methods → publish)

## Multi-step Workflows

Some common multi-step workflows:

### Create a SQL View on a Catalog Table

Use `add_asset_to_project` to bring a catalog table into a project. Additionally, once the asset is in the project, you can also call `create_asset_from_sql_query` to create a SQL view on top of it using the connection that backs the table.

**Example prompts:**
- "Create a SQL view that shows only shipped orders from the sales_orders table"
- "I want to query customer_data from the Enterprise Catalog in my Analytics project"
- "Reference the inventory_master asset in the Supply Chain project so we can create SQL queries against it"

### Publish Asset from Project to Catalog

1. `search_asset` → Find the asset in the source project if you only know its name or need to confirm it exists
2. `publish_asset_to_catalog` → Publish the project asset to the target catalog using native platform publish behavior

Note: Use `publish_asset_to_catalog` when the source is a project and the destination is a catalog. This operation follows the platform publish flow rather than creating a simple copy.

### Create and Publish URL Data Product

1. `create_or_update_url_data_product` → Create a URL data product draft
2. `attach_business_domain_to_data_product` → Attach a business domain
3. `attach_url_contract_to_data_product` → Attach a URL contract
4. `publish_data_product` → Publish the data product

### Create and Publish Data Product from an asset in a container

Note: Container can be a catalog or a project.

1. `create_update_data_product_from_asset_in_container` → Create a data product draft from catalog/project
2. `attach_business_domain_to_data_product` → Attach a business domain
3. `attach_url_contract_to_data_product` → Attach a URL contract
4. `find_data_product_delivery_methods_based_on_connection` → Find available delivery methods
5. `add_delivery_methods_to_data_product` → Add delivery methods
6. `publish_data_product` → Publish the data product
