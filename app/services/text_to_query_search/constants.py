TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Use this tool when you need to searched items and return list of fetched data.
                       This tool is capable of generating dynamic search queries and executing them against search engine based on natural language input.
                       It may find data based on items metadata ( linked connection, tags, assigned business terms, schema details, etc.)
                       It may find different types of data. Possible artifact types: [data_asset, data_asset_column, connection, ibm_data_source, data_rule, data_rule_definition, glossary_term, category, job, classification, data_class, data_protection_rule, reference_data, metadata_import, metadata_enrichment_area ]
                       This function takes a user's search prompt as input and may take container type: project or catalog, project_and_catalog. Default container type to project_and_catalog.
                       It can only find items in the specified container when container_name is specified in the request.
                       It then returns list of items that has been found. Response object contains also query that was generated based on user's input. Always include this as a part of your response.
                       The response may include an optional message field with additional information. Always include the message in your response if present.

                       Examples:
                        - Give me assets tagged customer in project AgentTest: search_prompt="Give me assets tagged customer in project AgentTest", container_name="AgentTest", container_type="project", artifact_types=["data_asset"]

                        - Find data quality rules: search_prompt="Find data quality rules", artifact_types=["data_rule"]
                        - Find data quality definitions: search_prompt="Find data quality definitions", artifact_types=["data_rule_definition"]
                        - Search for assets and columns in project AgentTest: search_prompt="Search for assets and columns in project AgentTest", container_type="project", container_name="AgentTest", artifact_types=["data_asset", "data_asset_column"]
                        - Search for assets in project AgentsDemo that are sourced from connection testConnName: search_prompt="Search for assets in project AgentsDemo that are sourced from connection testConnName", container_name="AgentsDemo", container_type="project", names_mapping=[{"name": "testConnName", "type": "connection"}]
                        - Search for assets in project AgentsDemo that are from MDI testMDIName: search_prompt="Search for assets in project AgentsDemo that are from MDI testMDIName", container_name="AgentsDemo", container_type="project", names_mapping=[{"name": "testMDIName", "type": "metadata_import"}]
                        - Show me assets modified by me: search_prompt="Show me assets modified by me"
                        - Find assets created by user jacob: search_prompt="Find assets created by user jacob", names_mapping=[{"name": "jacob", "type": "user"}]
                       
                       IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
                       - values are wrapped in the request
                       - search_prompt cannot be empty
                       - ALWAYS pass the user's FULL ORIGINAL QUESTION exactly as provided to search_prompt parameter. DO NOT try to optimise or shorten the questions. It may have impact on the quality of search results
                       - container_type must be one of: "catalog", "project", "project_and_catalog"
                       - If the user asks about specific container (project or catalog) by its name add this value as container_name parameter.
                       - If the user specified a type of asset, populate the 'artifact_types' parameter with that value. Otherwise, leave the 'artifact_types' parameter as "data_asset".
                            Possible artifact types: [data_asset, data_asset_column, connection, ibm_data_source, data_rule, data_rule_definition, glossary_term, category, job, classification, data_class, data_protection_rule, reference_data ]
                            Use only types specified in the list above.
                       - Current user context is ALWAYS sent by default. The tool automatically includes current user details in every query.
                       - If the user mentions named entities (like specific connection names, metadata import area names, or OTHER user names) that are NOT catalog/project names, use the names_mapping parameter.
                            Format: [{"name": "entityName", "type": "entityType"}]
                            Supported types: "connection", "metadata_import", "metadata_enrichment_area", "category", "user"
                            The tool will automatically resolve these names to IDs and pass them to the query generation API.
                            For user type, you can specify other users by name (e.g., "jacob", "john.doe") to search for assets related to those specific users.
                            Example:
                            - Search for assets created by user jacob: names_mapping=[{"name": "jacob", "type": "user"}]
                       - Invalid values will result in errors
                       - ALWAYS include subset or whole list of found data in your response with all details.
                       - If there's search query included in the response please return it.                     
                       Query API Reference: https://api.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/semantic_automation/v1/swagger-ui/index.html
                       Returns: The generated search query, list of matching assets with their metadata and URLs, and an optional message if results exceed the display limit or when assets are selected."""
